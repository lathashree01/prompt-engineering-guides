# Info on Prompt Engineering
- [Prompt engineering wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering)

Prompt engineering is the process of structuring or crafting an instruction to produce the best possible output from a generative artificial intelligence (AI) model.
A prompt is a natural language description of a task for an AI. In the case of a text-to-text language model, a prompt can take the form of a query, a command, or a more extended statement that includes context, instructions, and previous conversation details. Prompt engineering can include crafting a query, defining a specific style, choosing appropriate words and grammar, supplying relevant context, or outlining a character for the AI to emulate.

When communicating with a text-to-image or a text-to-audio model, a typical prompt is a description of a desired output such as "a high-quality photo of an astronaut riding a horse" or "Lo-fi slow BPM electro chill with organic samples".Prompting a text-to-image model may involve adding, removing, emphasizing, and re-ordering words to achieve a desired subject, style, layout, lighting, and aesthetic.
